            <b>Hi, my name is Can!</b> I happily survived the days of early web development. Since then, my work has revolved around creating engaging user experiences, building powerful web apps or pushing web servers and databases to their fullest potential.

            I work in .NET / PHP environments while spending a lot of time with modern Javascript solutions like Node or Angular. HTML, CSS, Canvas, jQuery / VanillaJS are my day-to-day tools. Databases like MSSQL or MySQL have always been part of my work as well as Windows or Linux Servers.

            Besides that, I use my PC's computational powers to play games, take my longboard out for a spin or just watch the sun set.
